## Introduction
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
With the United States setting new records for positive cases each day, people are being asked to shelter in place as much as possible.


Online streaming services have tens of thousands of movies to help people pass the time, but not everyone can afford to pay for multiple services at once, especially during economic uncertainty.

Our mission is to analyze the top four streaming services to help consumers pick the one that best suits them.

## Analysis
### Datasets
Datasets are from Kaggle.com and include:
- Movies available on Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and Disney+
- All Oscar Awards between 1927 - 2020

### Questions

When choosing a streaming service, how do you decide which one is right for you? Different people have different values. Some may want access to the largest movie library. Others may value quality over quantity, using either aggregate scores or Oscar Awards for reference. Multilingual households may want to watch movies in their native language as a family activity. 

To address these needs and more, we decided to answer specific questions about each streaming service:

- What is the total number of movies across each platform in the United States?
- What are the top genres?
- Which service has the highest number of recently released movies (past 5 years)?
- What are the top languages of movies?
- What are the Rotten Tomatoes scores of their content?
- What are the IMDb ratings of their content?
- Which service has the highest number of Oscar Award winning and nominated movies?
- How old are the movies that were nominated for Best Picture?

## Results

After analyzing each service, we recommend that consumers choose the following:

- Netflix if you value IMDb ratings and recent releases within the past 2 years
- Hulu if you value Rotten Tomatoes ratings
- Prime Video if you value Oscar Award wins and nominations, and want access to the largest library
- Disney+ if you value alternative genres and family friendly content

##### Choose the streaming service that motivates you to stay at home and together, we can flatten the curve.
